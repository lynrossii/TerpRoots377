<b>Thank you for using TerpRoots!</b>

<b>Getting Started</b>

When you open our TerpRoots, you will see our logo and two buttons at the bottom of the page: sign up and login. If you select sign up,
the user will need to enter their first name, last name, email address, password (and repeat the password to validate that it is correct), the user's
status or classification (student, faculty, alumni, parent), and their major (if applicable). <i>Note that your email address will be your username 
for the purposes of our web application.</i>

Once you create your account, you will be redirected to a thank you screen and will proceed to login with your newly created credentials.

<b>Navigating TerpRoots</b>

Upon successfully logging in, you will see a home page with a top-level menu and four options: home, organizations, events, and account. The home
button will take you back to the home page. The organizations page has a list of organizations at the University of Maryland. Upon clicking on 
an organization, the user can learn more about that organization's mission, the type of organiation they are (academic, social, religious,
service, greek, etc.), contact information, and social media handles. The events page is where the user can add events to their calendar. 
Simply click and drag a burgundy-colored event from the left hand pane onto the calendar. <i>Note: there is an option to remove the 
event from the left hand pane after dropping it onto your calendar. This decreases how long the event list is.</i> The user can break the calendar down into
the day, week, and month. If the calendar is in the month view, events will appear solely for the day; it won't be broken down into time slots. For the daily or weekly
calendar view, the user can put the event in a specific time block. The account page allows the user to view their profile information, change their password,
or change their email address. Upon signing out, the session will end and you will be routed to a page signaling that you have signed out. There is a button to take you 
back to the landing page where you can sign back in or create another account. 

<b>We hope you enjoy TerpRoots!</b>
